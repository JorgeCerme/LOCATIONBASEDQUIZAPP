LOCATION BASED QUIZ APP : USER GUIDE

The app is able to as soon as it is launched to track the movement of the user. This tracking is obtained after clicking on the button shown at the bottom of the page which says “Click Me Here To Get Your Location”. The latitude and longitude are displayed just on the same division of this button and a blue marker appears on the location of the user. 

Whilst displacing, this blue marker would follow the user leaving a trail. If the app or the server are restarted, this trace of displacement of the user is eliminated from the map shown on the main part of the page and the new location of the user is shown instead. 

The end-user will receive popping alerts with 4 option multiple choice questions when their location is close enough to specific question positions. These 5 specifically located questions are represented as the other 5 blue markers that appear as the app is launched. There is an option of adding more questions to specified positions which is done by the Question Setting Browser App: https://github.com/JorgeCerme/QUESTIONSETTING.

The user then answers the question by choosing one of the four options and feedback is posteriorly presented to the end client by informing if their chosen answer is correct or incorrect with a popping alert. To obtain this in a browser app not only as a phone app, follow the following link: http://developer.cege.ucl.ac.uk:31291
